This is a very simple iOS application that acts as a polyphonic synthesizer. It uses an `AVAudioUnitSampler`
instance to generate the sounds for touched keys. The sounds that are avaiable come from _sound font_ files such
as those available [online](http://www.synthfont.com/links_to_soundfonts.html) for free (and of variable
quaility). This app only supports sound font files that are bundled with the application, though it would be
nice to remotely fetch one to try it out.

## User Interface

Here is what you can do with it:

* Switch between the patches view (image above) and a _favorites_ view (see below) by swiping left/right on the upper view with two touches.
* Double-tapping the patch name in the info bar above the keyboard will also switch the upper view
* You can touch the labels at either end of the black bar to change the range of the keyboard. In the image
  above, the first key is at "C4" and the last key shown is "G5". You can go as low as "C0" and as high as "C9".
* You can also swipe with a finger on back bar to change the keyboard range
* Swipe right on a patch name to make it a favorite (same to unfavorite). Favorited patches have a star next to
  their name.

## Favorites

The favorites view shows all of the patches that have been "faved" or "starred". Pressing on a favorite will
make its associated patch active. You can also reorder them by long-touching one and moving it to a new location among the 
others. You can also change the starting key of the keyboard in the favorite as
well as gain and stereo pan settings that will apply when the favorite is touched. To edit a favorite,
double-tap on the it and you should see an edit view:

Nothing fancy. Note that the _gain_ is not exactly like a volume. By default, it will be at 0.0 which means that
there is no gain applied to the synthesizer output. Positive values (max +12) will boost the signal, while
negative values (min -90) will reduce it. Note that these are the min/max values supported by the
`AVAudioUnitSampler`.

The _pan_ value is normally at 0.0. Moving to -1.0 should place the output entirely in the left speaker, while a
+1.0 will place it all in the right.

## Dependencies

There are no external dependencies. I wrote the code in Xcode 10.1, targeting iOS 12.1.

The keys of the keyboard are painted by the code found in `KeyboardRender.swift`. This was generated by the
[PaintCode](https://www.paintcodeapp.com) application. The PaintCode file is `Keyboard.pcvd`, but it is not part
of the build process and PaintCode is not necessary to build.

## Sound Fonts

The repository comes with four SoundFont files, though the largest one -- `FluidR3_GM` -- is too large to store
natively on Github so it has been broken into three files: `FluidR3_GM.sf2.1`, `FluidR3_GM.sf2.2`, and
`FluidR3_GM.sf2.3`. To make the`FluidR3\_GM` file, you will need to run a simple Bash script -- `FluidR3\_GM.sh`
-- like so:

```
% ./FluidR3_GM.sh
```

There is also a simple Python script called `catalog.py` which will generate a SoundFont catalog in Swift. Each
`*.sf2` that is in the
[./SoundFonts](https://github.com/bradhowes/SoundFonts/tree/master/SoundFonts/MIDI/SoundFonts) directory
will get its own `*.swift` file with its own `SoundFont` instance that describes all of the patches or presets
that were found in the `*.sf2` file. If you add a new SoundFont file to this directory, you will also need to
add it to the Xcode project so that it gets installed in the iOS application bundle. You will also need to add
the generated `*.swift` file as well so that the application knows what presets are available in the SoundFont
file.

The `catalog.py` script uses the [sf2utils](https://pypi.org/project/sf2utils/) package to perform the Soundfont
parsing.
