 Implementation of a low-frequency triangular oscillator. By design, this LFO emits bipolar values from -1.0 to 1.0 in
 order to be useful in SF2 processing. One can obtain unipolar values via the DSP::bipolarToUnipolar method. An LFO
 will start emitting with value 0.0, again by design, in order to smoothly transition from a paused LFO into a running
 one. An LFO can be configured to delay oscillating for N samples. During that time it will emit 0.0.
