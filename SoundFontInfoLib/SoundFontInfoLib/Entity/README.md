#  Entity Namespace

Contains various class definitions that match attributes and memory layouts found in the SF2 spec. Note that there are some classes where
alignment requirements cause the size of an entity to not match that specified in the spec. These classes are clearly identified and they have
the proper loading mechanism to accommodate the layout padding.
