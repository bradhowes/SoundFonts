#  Render Namespace

This namespace contains the classes used to render audio samples from an SF2 preset. In contrast with the `Entity` namespace whose
classes map closely to the SF2 spec, this collection is geared to efficient generation of audio samples, but it relies on various `Entity` 
values to do so.
