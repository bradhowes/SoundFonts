#  DSP Namespace

Collection of common routines used for digital signal processing. Many of these are specific to working with MIDI and SF2 concepts.
There are several lookup tables that convert from a MIDI value in the range [0-127] to a floating-point value. These are generated at 
compile-time for fast loading at runtime.
