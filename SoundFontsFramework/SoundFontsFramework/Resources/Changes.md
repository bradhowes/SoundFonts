Note to self: this file is used to record the major changes made between versions.
It is parsed by `ChangesCompiler.compile` to build up a collection of items to show to the user.
The parsing is really simplistic:

- if a line begins with '# ' then it must contain a version string.
- always put most-recent changes at the top of the file (versions in descending order)
- if a line begins with '* ' then it is a change entry to show to the user. The change *must* be all on one line (keep it short and sweet)
