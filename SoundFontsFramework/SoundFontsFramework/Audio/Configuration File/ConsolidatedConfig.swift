/**
 Originally, the SoundFonts app loaded three separate config files. However, there was risk of data corruption if the
 files were not updated all at once. This was made worse with the AUv3 component, since it and the app shared the same
 configuration files. This consolidated version stores everything in one file, so the risk of corruption is reduced.
 Further, it relies on UIDocument which provides a safe and reliable means of making changes and writing them to disk
 even if there are two or more parties doing it. For our case, we just let the last one win without notifying the user
 that there was even a conflict.
