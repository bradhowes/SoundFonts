#
# A command-line script for incrementing build numbers for all known targets in an Xcode project.
#
# This script has two main goals: firstly, to ensure that all the targets in a project have the
# same CFBundleVersion and CFBundleShortVersionString values. This is because mismatched values
# can cause a warning when submitting to the App Store. Secondly, to ensure that the build number
# is incremented appropriately when git has changes.
#
# If not using git, you are a braver soul than I.

##
# The xcodeproj. This is usually found by the script, but you may need to specify its location
# if it's not in the same folder as the script is called from (the project root if called as a
# build phase run script).
#
# This value can also be provided (or overridden) using "--xcodeproj=<path>"
#
#xcodeproj="Project.xcodeproj"

##
# We have to define an Info.plist as the source of truth. This is typically the one for the main
# target. If not set, the script will try to guess the correct file from the list it gathers from
# the xcodeproj file, but this can be overriden by setting the path here.
#
# This value can also be provided (or overridden) using "--plist=<path>"
#
#plist="Project/Info.plist"

##
# By default, the script ensures that the build number is incremented when changes are declared
# based on git's records. Alternatively the number of commits on the current branch can be used
# by toggling the "reflect_commits" variable to true. If not on "master", the current branch name
# will be used to ensure no version collisions across branches, i.e. "497-develop".
#
# This setting can also be enabled using "--reflect-commits"
#
#reflect_commits=true

##
# If you would like to iterate the build number only when a specific branch is checked out
# (i.e. "master"), you can specify the branch name. The current version will still be replicated
# across all Info.plist files (to ensure consistency) if they don't match the source of truth.
#
# This setting can be enabled for multiple branches can be enabled by using comma separated names
# (i.e. "master,develop"). No spacing is permitted.
#
# This setting can also be enabled using "--branch"
#
#enable_for_branch="master"
